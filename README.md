# MABL launcher for PenumbraOS

This is primary user entrypoint app for [PenumbraOS](https://github.com/PenumbraOS/), the full development platform for the late Humane Ai Pin.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is extremely experimental and currently is usable by developers only.

MABL exposes a plugin archecture built around the Android SDK ecosystem to enable users to install different implementations of LLMs (local, remote, realtime audio), TTS and STT, separate apps (like a timer or notes app), etc.
